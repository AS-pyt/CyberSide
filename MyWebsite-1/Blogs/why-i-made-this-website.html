    <p>I honestly made this website because I was bored.</p>

    <p>There wasn't some grand plan or epic inspiration. I just had time on my hands, and I thought, "Why not build something?" That "something" became this site.</p>

    <p>It gave me a space to experiment with code, drop random thoughts, and maybe even share some useful things. If someone finds value in it — great. If not, I still had fun building it.</p>

    <p>More stuff coming soon (probably).</p>
